I’ve had the pleasure of knowing Jared for 4.5 months, during which we studied and collaborated on projects together in our bootcamp. Above all, I was impressed with Jared’s ability to understand complex problems and solve them faster than the average student. His unparalleled diligence allows him to create well crafted projects, and clean and precise code. And, of course, his ability to collaborate and bring joy to any team he comes aboard. Any company who is lucky enough to hire him will drastically improve the culture at the company. Jared would be a true asset for any positions requiring any full-stack work and comes with my heartfelt recommendation."',
